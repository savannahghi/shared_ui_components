# shared_ui_components

`shared_ui_components` is an open source project &mdash; it's one among many other shared libraries that make up the wider ecosystem of software made and open sourced by `Savannah Informatics Limited`.

A shared library for `BeWell-Consumer` and `BeWell-Professional` that is responsible for rendering and exposing dumb widgets and ui components

## Installation Instructions

Use this package as a library by depending on it

Run this command:

- With Flutter:

```dart
$ flutter pub add shared_ui_components
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit dart pub get):

```dart
dependencies:
  shared_ui_components: ^0.1.26-nullsafety
```

Alternatively, your editor might support flutter pub get. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

Lastly:

Import it like so:

```dart
import 'package:shared_ui_components/buttons.dart';
```
